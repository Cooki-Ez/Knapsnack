# Knapsnack
Knapsnack algorithm implemented in Java
---------
TASK
---------
Implement the brute force solution of the knapsack problem. Subsets of items should be
represented as binary vectors. Generate all vectors (from 0000 . . . 0000 to 1111 . . . 1111),
where the n-th bit is ‘1’ if the n-th element is present in the subset and ‘0’ otherwise.
HINT: store the vector as an integer and extract values using bitwise operations.
The program should output the vector representing the optimal subset of the input
set in knapsack.txt (you can read it from the file or paste it in your code).
